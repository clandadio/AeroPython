2021 CU Aero Design Avionics Code

This is the code used to run the plan avionics for Aero in 20/21.
It is pretty sketchy in a lot of places because I don't actually know how to code.

The files beginning with MP_ are the ones needed to run the plane.
I commented the code as best I could to explain the thought process and make editing easy
